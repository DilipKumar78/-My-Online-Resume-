<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>It is used specially for the compression of images where tolerable degradation is required. 
        With the wide use of computers and consequently need for large scale storage and transmission
         of data, efficient ways of storing of data have become necessary. With the growth of technology 
         and entrance into the Digital Age the world has found itself amid a vast amount of information.
          Dealing with such enormous information can often present difficulties. Image compression is minimizing
           the size in bytes of a graphics file without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level.
            The reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space.
             It also reduces the time required for images to be sent over the Internet or downloaded from Web pages.
              JPEG and JPEG 2000 are two important techniques used for image compression. JPEG image compression standard 
              use DCT (DISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORM). The discrete cosine transform is a fast transform. It is a widely used and 
              robust method for image compression. It has excellent compaction for highly correlated data.DCT has fixed basis images DCT gives good 
              compromise between information packing ability and computational complexity. JPEG 2000 image compression standard makes use of DWT (DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM).
               DWT can be used to reduce the image size without losing much of the resolutions computed and values less than a pre-specified threshold are discarded. 
               Thus it reduces the amount of memory required to represent given image.</p>
