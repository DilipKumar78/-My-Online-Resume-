<h1>Web Phishing Detection</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<P>Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information
         or downloading malicious software. As the internet continues to grow and become more central 
         to our daily lives, phishing attacks have become more sophisticated and more prevalent. 
         In response, researchers and practitioners have developed a range of techniques and tools 
         for detecting and preventing phishing attacks. One important area of focus is web phishing
          detection, which involves analyzing the content and structure of websites to identify signs 
          of phishing. This paper provides an overview of the current state of research on web phishing
           detection, including common techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We also discuss some
            of the challenges and opportunities for future research in this area, including the need for 
            more comprehensive and realistic datasets, the importance of incorporating user behavior and 
            context into phishing detection algorithms, and the potential for using machine learning and 
            other advanced techniques to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives. Overall, 
            we argue that web phishing detection is an important and challenging area of research that has
             the potential to help protect users from the growing threat of phishing attacks.</P>
