<h1>Privacy Protection and Content Restriction using Raspberry Pi</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Ad-blocking is recommended for privacy protection and content restriction in this project. This all comes together with the help of the Raspberry Pi for setting it up as a web server. Ad-blocking is a popular method to prevent advertisements from appearing on websites or other software applications, which can improve web browsing speed, reduce data usage, and improve privacy by blocking tracking scripts. Pi-hole, a network-wide ad blocker that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi, is a popular ad blocking option. Pi-hole acts as a DNS server, filtering out ad requests before they can be loaded on network-connected devices. Setting up a home server with a Raspberry Pi can also be a fun project for those who are interested in networking, Linux, and server administration. Because of its low cost, low power consumption, and small size, the Raspberry Pi is a popular choice for home servers. To store files, run applications, and perform other network-related tasks, Nginx, media servers, web servers, and game servers can all be installed on a Raspberry Pi.
         When security and data backup best practices are followed, a home server setup using a Raspberry Pi can provide a reliable and secure
          solution for personal computing needs.</p>
